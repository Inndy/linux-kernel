	  This enables support for accessing all type of NAND flash
	  devices through the BCM7400 NAND controller.

	bool "Verify Broadcom NAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  Broadcom NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.
